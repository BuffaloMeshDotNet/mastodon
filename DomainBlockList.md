# Domain Block List for social.buffalomesh.net

Various levels of blocking occur.  We try to stick with silence, but in the case of illegal activities, we will also block media to protect the organization.

Rarely is suspend used, primarily, while we do support freedom of association, we do not want things contrary to our usage agreement to be in the publicly federated timeline.
